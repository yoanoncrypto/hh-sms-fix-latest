  # Fix Authentication and RLS Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Update RLS policies for all tables to allow proper authenticated access
    - Enable comprehensive CRUD operations for authenticated users
    - Maintain security while allowing bulk operations

  2. Policy Changes
    - Remove restrictive policies that were causing 401 errors
    - Add permissive policies for authenticated users
    - Ensure service role has full access for system operations

  3. User Management
    - Allow authenticated users to manage user data
    - Enable bulk import functionality
    - Support user creation, updates, and deletion
